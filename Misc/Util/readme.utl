The archive contains a collection of small units; in the past some of the
units were available separately.

The units and basic test programs can be compiled with the usual Pascal
(TP5/5.5/6, BP7, VP 2.1, FPC 1.0/2.0/2.2/2.4/2.6/3+) and Delphi (1..7/9/
10/12/17/18/25/26) versions.

Online help is available as Windows .hlp file or as a .tph for BP7 IDE.

 * Base2N V0.42: General base 2**N conversion routines (N=1...6)

 * Bitarray V0.19: Bit array context with max. 524160 bits (spin off from
   MPArith 16 bit prime sieve)

 * BTypes V0.21: Portable common basic types

 * Compvers V0.41: Compiler version as string or symbol

 * Dates V0.38: Implements compiler and OS independent routines for the
   current date and time (including milliseconds since midnight) and functions
   for Julian day numbers.

 * Hrtimer V0.29: Contains a high resolution timer for most Pascal/Delphi
   compilers using the comp data type. It uses the RDTSC instruction,
   therefore it will stop on machines (except ARM) that do not support RDTSC
   (this feature can be turned off via $ifdef). The timer is used by several
   optimizing test programs.

 * memh V0.15: Implements portable heap memory allocation functions

 * Mem_util V0.99: Implements compiler independent routines for comparing
   memory blocks and converting memory blocks to HEX and Base64 strings.

 * Ministat V0.45: Statistics unit with accurate "on the fly" statistics
   routines for one and two variables.

 * Sort V1.18: General QuickSort, HeapSort (standard and bottom-up), CombSort
   routines using swap/compare functions. Additional pointer versions have a
   typeless data pointer that is carried through the functions and can be used
   to access local data etc. by the caller.

 * std.inc V1.75: Standard include file for compiler detection, standard
   definitions, options.

 * Tsc V0.44: This unit has a more low level access to the Time Stamp Counter
   than hrtimer and additionally defines a system dependent low resolution
   counter (GetTickCount, 18.2 Hz Systick, or milliseconds since midnight) if
   RDTSC support is not available.
