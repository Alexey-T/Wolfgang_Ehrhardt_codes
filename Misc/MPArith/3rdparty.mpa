LibTomMath 0.30+, multiple-precision integer library,
by Tom St Denis

  LibTomMath is a library that provides multiple-precision
  integer arithmetic as well as number theoretic functionality.

  The library was designed directly after the MPI library by
  Michael Fromberger but has been written from scratch with
  additional optimizations in place.

  The library is free for all purposes without any express
  guarantee it works.
