This archive contains Pascal source for multi precision integer, rational,
real and complex floating point arithmetic and functions. The basic routines
can be compiled with the usual Pascal versions that allow const parameters
(tested with BP 7.0, VP 2.1, FPC 1.0/2.0/2.2/2.4/2.6/3x, and Delphi versions
2..7/9-10/12/17/18/25/26).

A separate introduction can be found in the mp_intro.txt; Windows and
Borland Pascal help files are included.

Last changes:

MPArith 1.39.12 with the following new/changed functions:

  * New functions: succd/s/x, predd/s/x in mp_rcalc, mpc_log10, mpc_is_ia in
    mp_cmplx, and the new unit mp_ccalc, which parses and evaluates
    mp_complex expressions;

  * Changed functions: adjust sign of mpc_arctanh on the branch cut, error
    MP_PRECISION in s_mpf_mod_pi2k instead of assert;

  * Other: configuration parameter MPC_NO_EXECPTIONS;

  * Bugfixes: mp_real: copy/paste bug in mpf_sinhcosh, subtle bug for
    mpf_arctan2(y,0), mp_cmplx: mpc_ln1p and mpc_expm1 for small imaginary a,
    mpc_arctanh for real |a| > 1.

  * The basic introduction and the multi precision calculator t_rcalc are
    updated, there is the new calculator t_ccalc for complex expressions.


For a complete list with brief descriptions see the mp_intro function list.

There are test programs that verify the functions and the compilation. Demo
programs are included for pi calculation, expression parsing and evaluation
(including two interactive multi precision calculators), factorization based
on Pollard's rho and p-1, Williams's p+1, and ECM methods, RSA attacks, etc.

My Pascal routines are based on many public resources (source code
libraries, books, articles), links are given in the mp_intro references.
