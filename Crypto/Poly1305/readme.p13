Poly1305-AES (designed by D. J. Bernstein) is "a state-of-the-art
message-authentication code" suitable for a wide variety of applications;
the key material is created using AES-128 and a nonce.

The general Poly1305 algorithm is a one-time authenticator which takes a
32-byte one-time key plus a message and produces a 16-byte tag. This tag is
used to authenticate the message. Regardless of how the key is generated, it
is partitioned into two parts, called "r" and "s". The pair (r,s) should be
unique, and must be unpredictable for each invocation (that is why it was
originally obtained by encrypting a nonce), while "r" may be constant.

My Pascal code in this archive is a straight-forward translation of two
variations of Andrew Moon's well-known poly1305-donna code (from Github,
distributed under MIT license or public domain):

  * poly_32x32 uses 32 x 32 -> 64 bit multiplication and is default for
    compilers with u/int64 data types (D4+, FPC),
  * poly_16x16 with 16 x 16 -> 32 bit multiplication for all other compilers
    without int64.
  * During development I also translated poly_8x8: it is available as a
    separate file, but not actually used (slower for all tested
    CPUs/compilers).

Poly1305 is standardized in RFC 7539 ("ChaCha20 and Poly1305 for IETF
Protocols"), which also contains additional test vectors.

In the following table the speed is measured on two system with the program
t_pbench (Win 98 with Pentium 4 1.7Ghz and Win 7/64 with Core i3-2350M). The
times in s are for processing 5120 messages with 16 KB, i.e. 80MB. BP7 uses
real 16 bit code, FPC and D18 used 64 bit-code on Win 7, all others are 32
bit code. D6 or newer use the $define poly_32x32.
