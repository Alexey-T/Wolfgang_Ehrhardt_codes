This archive contains Pascal/Delphi sources for the XTEA cipher.

XTEA (eXtended TEA) is a compact 64-bit block cipher with 128-bit keys
described by David Wheeler and Roger Needham.

There is code for a DLL and the following modes of operation are
supported: CBC, CFB, CTR, ECB, OFB. All modes allow plain and cipher
text lengths that need not be multiples of the block length (for ECB and
CBC cipher text stealing is used for the short block). CTR mode can use
4 built-in incrementing functions or a user supplied one, and provides
seek functions for random access reads.

All modes support a reset function that re-initializes the chaining
variables without the (time consuming) recalculation of the round keys.
