This archive contains Pascal source for the Sosemanuk stream cipher.

Sosemanuk by C. Berbain et al. is a stream cipher that is included in
the final eSTREAM Portfolio.

The key length is variable between 128 and 256 bits, and IVs up to 128
bit are supported (although my code uses 128 bit IVs). A reduced variant
of the Serpent block cipher is used for key and IV setup. The core key
stream is generated in 80 byte blocks using (among others) an LFSR
(Linear Feedback Shift Register) with ten 32 bit values and a FSM
(Finite State Machine) with 64 bits.

In the following table my Pascal implementations (program t_sosewe, 1.8
GHz P4 with Win98) are compared with the reference C code (rows GCC and
VC6) from the eSTREAM archive. Times and speeds for processing 800 MB (1
Mio 800 byte blocks) are measured for key stream generation (columns k)
and encryption (columns e). The speed does not depend on the key length.

My source is based on sosemanukfast.java from the eSTREAM submission for
the 32 bit code and 16 bit key stream generator; for 16 bit key/IV setup
a modification of my Serpent code is used.
