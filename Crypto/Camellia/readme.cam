This archive contains Pascal/Delphi sources for the Camellia cipher.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Although NTT has published open source code of Camellia, the users
of this unit should read my legal.txt and NTT's Intellectual Property

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Feistel block cipher Camellia has been developed by NTT (Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone) and Mitsubishi. It uses 128-bit input/output
data blocks and 128, 192, or 256 bit keys. Camellia is a recommended
block cipher of the NESSIE portfolio, included in ISO/IEC 18033-3 and
also described in RFC 3713.

There is code for a DLL and the following modes of operation are
supported: CBC, CFB128, CTR, ECB, OFB, OMAC, CCM, GCM, and EAX. All modes
allow plain and cipher text lengths that need not be multiples of the
block length (for ECB and CBC cipher text stealing is used for the short
block). CTR mode can use 4 built-in incrementing functions or a user
supplied one, and provides seek functions for random access reads.
Please note that although my code supports EAX, this mode is not tested
against public test vectors.

All modes of operation (except OMAC/CCM/EAX) support a reset function
that re-initializes the chaining variables without the recalculation of
the round keys.

Additionally there is the variable-length key CMAC PRF-128.

Please note: If you compile 32 bit code under an old 386 CPU you must
$undef USE_BSWAP in cam_base.pas!
