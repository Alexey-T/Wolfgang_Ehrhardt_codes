This archive contains Pascal/Delphi sources for the SEED cipher.

The SEED cipher has been developed by KISA (Korea Information Security
Agency). It uses 128-bit input/output data blocks and 128-bit keys. SEED
is specified in ISO/IEC 18033-3 and also described in RFC 4269.

There is code for a DLL and the following modes of operation are
supported: CBC, CFB128, CTR, ECB,OFB, OMAC, and EAX. All modes allow
plain and cipher text lengths that need not be multiples of the block
length (for ECB and CBC cipher text stealing is used for the short
block). CTR mode can use 4 built-in incrementing functions or a user
supplied one, and provides seek functions for random access reads.

All modes of operation (except OMAC/EAX) support a reset function that
re-initializes the chaining variables without the recalculation of the
round keys.
