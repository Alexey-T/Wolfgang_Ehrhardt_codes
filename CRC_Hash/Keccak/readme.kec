On Oct. 2, 2012 NIST announced Keccak, designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan
Daemen, Michael Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche, as the winner of the
SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition.

This archive contains my preliminary Pascal/Delphi Keccak implementation
using the SHA-3 NIST API: arbitrary length bit sequences are allowed for
the messages to be hashed, the supported digest lengths are 224, 256,
384, 512 bits, and arbitrary length byte output.

The HMAC routines use the block length values proposed by David Ireland
and are verified against his test vectors, but note that HMAC-Keccak is
even more preliminary than SHA-3/Keccak!

Right now, there are two basic code variants of Keccak-f[1600]: The first
with 32-bit interleaving and rotate instructions coded inline in 32+ bit
PurePascal or inline functions for 16-bit compilers; the second uses
64-bit data types and rotations. However, the 64-bit code is faster than
32-bit only if compiled for a 64-bit CPU and executed on a 64-bit OS!
Here the Cycles/Byte and MB/s values, measured on Win7/64 with Intel
Core i3-2350M(2.3GHz):

             FPC260/64-Bit   FPC260/32-Bit    D17 / 64-Bit   D17 / 32-Bit
Name         Cyc/B   MB/s     Cyc/B   MB/s    Cyc/B   MB/s   Cyc/B   MB/s
Keccak-224    30.3  75.74      71.9  31.91     22.5 102.03    60.8  37.76
Keccak-256    32.5  70.68      75.5  30.41     23.7  96.65    64.2  35.77
Keccak-384    41.8  54.84      95.2  24.11     31.0  73.96    82.3  27.87
Keccak-512    59.7  38.46     132.5  17.32     44.7  51.35   116.9  19.62

** Remark: Keccak is NOT integrated in the Hash unit, because the
** formal SHA-3 algorithm (and the associated HMAC) is not yet specified.

The routines in this archive can be compiled with most current Pascal
(TP 5/5.5/6, BP 7, VP 2.1, FPC 1.0/2.0/2.2/2.4/2.6) and Delphi versions
(tested with V1 up to V7/9/10/12/17).

For compilation of t_speedk.pas you need the HRTimer sources from the
util_<yyyy-mm-dd>.zip, some tests need KAT files from the Keccak site.
