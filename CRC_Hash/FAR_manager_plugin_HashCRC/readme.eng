Description
===========
This plugin for FAR Manager calculates CRCs and Hash message digests of
files in the active file panel. Supported are CRC16/24/32/64, Adler32,
eDonkey, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD160, SHA1, SHA224/256/384/512, Whirlpool.

Version 1.17 fixes a SHA512/384 bug for file sizes above 512MB


Installation
============
Copy the HashCRC folder into Far\Plugins and restart FAR


Updating
========
Quit all FAR instances and overwrite the old plugin files with the files
of the new version. If there are any difficulties, please read the file
Plugins.Install.txt or InstallPlugins.txt from the FAR documentation.


Known Problems
==============
Starting with V1.6 and the support of SHA384/SHA512, old FAR versions
(1.70 Beta3 and below) will truncate the result display if all sums are
calculated (there can be a maximum of 13 items in the message box).


Acknowledgements
================
- Dmitry Yerokhin for Russian translations of the .hlp and .lng files
- Giovanni Drusian for the MD5-PE feature and help during implementation
- Sergey Golachev for reporting the 4GB issue


Compiling
=========
For recompilation you need the plugin source HashCRC117_Src.zip
and the CRC/Hash sources from crc_hash_<yyyy-mm-dd>.zip. The
distributed plugin dll is built with Delphi 3.
