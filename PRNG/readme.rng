This archive contains seven fast pseudo random number generators with
period lengths much greater than Pascal's random function: taus88 and
taus113 (Pierre L'Ecuyer), tt800 and mt19937 (Makoto Matsumoto et al,
mt19937 is the famous Mersenne Twister), kiss123 (George Marsaglia),
well1024a (Panneton, L'Ecuyer, Matsumoto) and xor4096 (Richard P. Brent).
All are implemented with context records, therefore several independent
generators can be used simultaneously, they are not cryptographically
secure. A TP/Delphi compatible LC generator with the common functions and
features can be found in unit pasrand.


In addition there are three cryptographic generators:

  * Bob Jenkins' public domain ISAAC random number generator
    (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count). The average cycle
    length of ISAAC is 2**8295, the minimum length is 2**40.

  * salsar is based upon the Salsa20 stream cipher and needs the salsa20
    unit (included in $supp_rng.zip) The core routine uses 128 bit keys
    and 8 rounds (this default value can be changed to 12 or 20 rounds
    with salsar_set_rounds).

  * aesr uses AES/CTR mode routines with 128 bit keys (included in
    $supp_rng.zip).


The units and basic test programs can be compiled with the usual Pascal
(TP5/5.5/6, BP7, VP 2.1, FPC 1.0/2.0/2.2/2.4/2.6,3.x) and Delphi
(1..7/9/10/12/17/18/25S) versions. Most test programs need the ministat
and/or the hrtimer unit.

Table of generator properties (C/B: CPU cycles per byte, MB/s: million
bytes per second. On 1.7 GHz Pentium 4 / Windows 98: BP7 = Borland
Pascal 7 real mode with 386 BASM and D6 = Delphi 6; on Win7/64 Core
i3-2350M: D18/64 = Delphi 18 64-bit. Note that isaac was compiled with
{$define testing}):
